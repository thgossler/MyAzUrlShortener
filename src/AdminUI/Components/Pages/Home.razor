    <h3>About This Application</h3>
    <p>This web application streamlines the management of short URLs, transforming lengthy web addresses into concise, shareable links.</p>

    <h4>Why You Need It</h4>
    <p>
        Imagine trying to reopen an important resource only to find your once-trusted link is broken, leading you into error pages and dead ends.
        Bookmarks often spread across various browsers and devices, making vital links disappear when they're needed most. With this tool,
        you regain control, reduce the risk of broken URLs, and spare yourself the mental strain of hunting for references.
    </p>

    <h4>Key Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>URL shortening: Convert long URLs into short, manageable links.</li>
        <li>Easy authentication: Secure access to the application with your work account.</li>
        <li>Short URL management: Create, update, and delete short URLs as needed.</li>
        <li>Scheduling: Set up one-time or recurring redirects for your short URLs.</li>
        <li>Performance tracking: Monitor click metrics to assess link engagement.</li>
        <li>Security: Self-hosted, i.e. no third-party have access to usage information.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
        By simplifying long URLs and providing scheduling and tracking capabilities, this tool significantly reduces
        the collective hassle of neglected bookmarks and broken redirects.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Legal and Usage Policy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This tool is provided strictly for lawful use and for company purposes only. Any illegal, abusive, or unauthorized
            use is prohibited.
        </li>
        @if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(privacyPolicyUrl))
        {
            <li>
                In general, the following <a href="@privacyPolicyUrl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a> applies.
            </li>
        }
        <li>
            This web app uses browser cookies only for secure user authentication and does not process personal information except 
            for the sign-in email address of users who create short URL records to verify their ownership.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not include personal information (PII) in target URLs or in vanity strings. Only use non-sensitive, business-related
            information.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-4" style="margin-top: 30px;">Vanity Naming Convention</h3>
    <p>
        Use the naming pattern <code>&lt;context&gt;-&lt;vanity&gt;</code> to make links recognizable and durable. The
        <em>context</em> should be stable for a long time, because vanities are not supposed to change once created.
        For example, prefix teamplay-specific vanities with <code>tp-</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Examples: <code>tp-onboarding</code>, <code>it-vpn-guide</code>, <code>hr-benefits-2025</code>.</li>
            <li>Choose a long-lived, team or domain-oriented context (e.g., <code>tp</code>, <code>DnA</code>, <code>IT</code>, <code>HR</code>).</li>
            <li>Keep the vanity descriptive and short; avoid dates unless truly necessary.</li>
        </ul>
