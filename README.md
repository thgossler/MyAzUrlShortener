### Alternative Admin Tool

By default, all the required resources are deployed into Azure. However you can decide to run the [API](src/Cloud5mins.ShortenerTools.Api/) locally, in a container or somewhere else. You can than use an API client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or a plugin to VSCode like [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client), to manage your URLs. We've included simple API calls via a postman collection and environment [here](./src/tools/).

You can also directly update the tables in storage using [Azure Storage Explorer](doc/how-to-use-azure-storage-explorer.md).
